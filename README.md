##### I'm real.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Birthday        | Are           | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| Gender     | M| 
| Favorite colors      | Red & Blue      |
| Favorite food | Ramen   |
| Pizza on pineapple | Rather weird   |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3



  
     
    

     Create a table with the following structure:

     Birthday: dd/mm
     Gender: ?
     Favorite color: ?
     Favorite food: ?
     Pinneapple on pizza: Yes/No (Extra challenge: make it look like a (un)checked checkbox)

     Hobbies (smaller header)
     This should contain a bullet list of your hobbies.
